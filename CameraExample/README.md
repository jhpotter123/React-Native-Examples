### CameraExample (React Native 0.68)

This is an older React Native project demonstrating use of native modules and camera functionality.  

⚠️ Note: `react-native-camera` triggers a ViewPropTypes deprecation warning on RN 0.68+. This is expected for older libraries.  

This project showcases:
- Integration with native Android modules
- Understanding of React Native architecture (TurboModules, Fabric)
- Older library management and troubleshooting

For newer camera projects, see my work with [React Native Vision Camera](link-to-new-project).
