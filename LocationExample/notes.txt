Copilot made a change and this file now looks like this.  May need to tweek if this is different from a clean pull.  Havce a look.

$ cat node_modules/react-native/Libraries/Components/DatePicker/DatePickerIOS.js
/**
 * Minimal shim for DatePickerIOS to satisfy Metro imports for older/newer RN mismatches.
 * This returns a no-op component â€” it's only used to avoid bundler errors in this sample app.
 */
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';

const DatePickerIOS = (props) => {
  return <View {...props} />;
};

export default DatePickerIOS;
